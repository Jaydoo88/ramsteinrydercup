Vision
Build an official event website for the Ramstein Ryder Cup that feels like a mix of:

golf event site

reunion/tradition site

trip planning hub

private group clubhouse

This should feel like Year 1 of a long-running tradition, not a one-time trip page.

Creative Website Concept
Theme Concept
“Founding Year / Clubhouse”
Make the website feel like the official launch of a tradition:

Founding Year: 2026

“First Annual” badge

Commissioner-led event

Team competition energy

Scottsdale desert + golf premium vibe

Private-club / tournament-week feel

Think:

Ryder Cup-inspired structure

Fantasy football commissioner organization

Golf trip swagger

Clean enough that spouses/significant others can use it too

Recommended Site Structure (Multi-Page)

Suggested standout copy
12-bedroom house = major advantage for group comfort

4) Pricing & Budget Page ✅ (Must be crystal clear)
Purpose: Build trust with transparent costs

This should look organized and easy to scan.

Include
Price tiers

This keeps people from asking you to resend files constantly.

Photo galleries by year

Commissioner updates

This makes the site a true tradition platform.

Deliverables to Request from Developer
Multi-page responsive website

Consistent header/footer/nav across pages

Editable content blocks (easy for updates)

RSVP form integration

Downloads page for flyer/rules

House gallery support

Clean mobile navigation

Version 1 launch-ready design using provided content

(Optional) CMS or simple admin-editable structure for annual updates

Bonus Creative Touches (Worth asking for)
1) “Founding 12” visual section
A row of 12 golfer slots/cards:

Filled as people commit

Creates urgency and exclusivity

2) “Commissioner Update” banner
Short status message at top:

“Invites are live”

“House option selected”

“Golf course planning in progress”

3) “Road to Scottsdale” timeline graphic
Makes the planning feel like part of the event experience.

Short version to tell your developer what you want (plain-English summary)
I do not want a one-page site. I want a creative multi-page event website that feels like the official home of the Ramstein Ryder Cup and can grow into an annual tradition.

It should have separate pages for:

Home

Trip Overview

House & Rooming

Pricing/Budget

Golf Format

Schedule/Logistics

Rules

RSVP

Downloads

(Optional) Commissioner’s Corner

The site should feel polished, exciting, and organized — like a real event brand — while clearly showing which details are tentative/estimated.
